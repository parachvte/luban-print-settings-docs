Skirt/Brim Minimum Length
====
### **Description**
The skirt/brim length refers to the total length of extrusion required to prime the nozzle when printing the skirt or brim. This setting makes sure that the nozzle is primed enough before starting a print, by adding more skirt or brim lines than originally requested by the [Skirt Line Count](skirt_line_count.md) or [Brim Line Count](brim_line_count.md) setting. If the minimum length in this setting is not reached by the total circumference of all the skirt or brim lines added together, more contours will be added.

The value of this setting should be set such that the volume extruded by this minimal length is just enough to prime the nozzle before a print.

### **Usage**
Placing tiny objects at the edge of your printer when this setting is large can cause the printer to move outside the working area.**
