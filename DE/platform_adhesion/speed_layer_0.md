Initial Layer Speed
====
### **Description**
This setting adjusts the speed at which the initial layer of the model is formed.

### **Usage**
Reducing the initial layer speed will improve the adhesion between the model and the build plate. This is because the material stays hotter for a longer time and can then flow out further, which can increase the adhesion.

For the initial layer, the [printing speed](speed_print_layer_0.md) can be adjusted separately from the [travel speed](speed_travel_layer_0.md). The speed at which the [brim and skirt](skirt_brim_speed.md) is printed can also be adjusted. By default, this setting affects all of those. However the [speed of the base layer of the raft](../platform_adhesion/raft_base_speed.md) is not affected.
