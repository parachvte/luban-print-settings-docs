Z Seam X
====
If Z Seam Alignment is set to User Specified, the seam will be placed close to the position specified by the Z Seam X and [Z Seam Y](z_seam_y.md) settings.

![The seam is located on the left side](../images/z_seam_x_left.png)
![The seam is located on the right side](../images/z_seam_x_right.png)

This setting indicates an absolute position on the build plate if [Z Seam Relative](z_seam_relative.md) is disabled, or a position relative to the centre of the model if Z Seam Relative is enabled.

It is best to choose a location where the seam will be hard to see in the final print. A location that is in an inside corner will be a good choice. But if such a corner is not available, you can also choose a position that allows the seam to be easily cut off or sanded down in post-processing.
