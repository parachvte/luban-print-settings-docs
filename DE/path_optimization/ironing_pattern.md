Ironing Pattern
====
Ironing covers the top surface with a path pattern. This setting determines which pattern is used to iron the top surface.

The goal of the pattern is to create a smooth, continuous surface. If there is an interruption in the pattern, it will create a visible border on the top surface.

Zigzag

This will make the nozzle go back and forth over the surface. It works fine and reliably for most surfaces, but will cause somewhat more borders than necessary.

Concentric
----

This will cause the nozzle to make circles from inside to outside. This will reduce the borders to a minimum, but if the concentric rings become very small in the centre, the nozzle will be lingering too long around the same spot, and thus leaves a visible spot on the surface. Therefore, this pattern works best for surfaces that are long and thin rather than surfaces that are round or square.
