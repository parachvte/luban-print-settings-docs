Enable Bridge Settings
====
### **Description**
Normally Luban will use a fairly rudimentary bridging technique. For an overhanging area on the model, Luban will adjust the direction of the lines that constitute the skin of this overhanging area, so as to optimize bridging and improves print quality. 

If this setting is enabled, you can optimize bridging more precisely based on your need.

![When a bridge is detected, the skin lines are oriented to bridge the gap as best it can](../images/bridge_settings_enabled_default.png)
![With bridge settings enabled, the bridging lines are printed with different settings](../images/bridge_settings_enabled_enabled.png)

### **Usage**
By enabling the bridging settings, you get greater control over how bridges are handled in your print. By tuning the bridging parameters very well, you can improve the quality of your overhangs significantly and improve accuracy in the vertical direction.
