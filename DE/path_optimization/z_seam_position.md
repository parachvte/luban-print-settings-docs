Z Seam Position
====
If Z Seam Alignment is set to User Specified, the seam will be placed in the relative position specified by this setting.

![The seam is located on the left side](../images/z_seam_x_left.png)
![The seam is located on the back side](../images/z_seam_y_back.png)
![The seam is located on the right side](../images/z_seam_x_right.png)
![The seam is located on the front side](../images/z_seam_y_front.png)

Eight options are available for you to adjust the position of the Z seam relative to the model. It is best to choose a location where the seam will be hard to see in the final print. A location that is in an inside corner will be a good choice. But if such a corner is not available, you can also choose a position that allows the seam to be easily cut off or sanded down in post-processing.

The seam is actually placed as close as possible to the position indicated by the [Z Seam X](z_seam_x.md) and [Z Seam Y](z_seam_y.md) settings. This is a convenience setting that sets those coordinates more intuitively.
