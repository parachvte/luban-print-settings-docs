Ironing Speed
====
This setting allows you to control how fast the nozzle moves during ironing.

The ironing speed is normally significantly slower than skin printing speed. This allows the top surface lines to fuse together. However, setting a slow ironing speed will increase the total printing time quite significantly, especially when the line width of ironing is small.

Ironing behaves widely different with different materials, so you may need to set different ironing speed for different materials.
