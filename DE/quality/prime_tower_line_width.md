Prime Tower Line Width
====
This setting determines the width of the lines with which the prime tower is drawn.

![The blue material has a larger line width than the orange material](../images/prime_tower_line_width.png)

Choosing a thicker line width causes the prime tower to print faster. If the volume extruded by one contour is sufficiently big, increasing this setting makes another loop unnecessary. However, increasing this setting too much can make the prime tower weaker because not enough material can be extruded fast enough.
