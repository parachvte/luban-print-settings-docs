Support Floor Line Width
====
This setting adjusts the width of the lines of the bottom side of the support.

![The support floor (darker blue) is printed with wider lines than the rest of the support](../images/support_bottom_line_width.png)

Printing thinner lines tends to reduce the adhesion where the support rests on the model. However, thinner lines also make the adhesion more constant and reliable. In general, thinner lines make the support easier to remove and leave less of a scar on the object, while printing thinner lines takes more printing time.
