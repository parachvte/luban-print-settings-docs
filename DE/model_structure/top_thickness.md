Top Thickness
====
### **Description**
This setting configures how thick the top layers of the print will be.

Different from the normal layers that are made up of walls and infill, the top layers are solid layers. They are fully printed so as to close the print.

### **Influence**
By increasing the thickness of the top layers, you can achieve the following effects:
* Your print will be stronger with a thick and solid top.
* The top surface will be smoother. Any pillowing and sagging on the upper part will get smoothed out by the layers put on top.
* Your model will be more watertight. A thicker top will be more capable of blocking water or other fluids from getting in.
* Your print will consume more material, since the top layers use more material than the normal layers that contain sparse infill.
* Your print will take more time, since more material must be placed down.
