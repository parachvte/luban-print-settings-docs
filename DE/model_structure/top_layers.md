Top Layers
====
### **Description**
This setting configures how many solid layers are printed for the top of the print. 

Different from the normal layers beneath them, the top layers are not made up of walls and infill. They are fully printed so as to close the print.

### **Influence**
By increasing the number of top layers, you can achieve the following effects:
* Your print will be stronger. Having more top layers will mean that your print will be made more firm, with less infill and more solid layers.
* The top surface will be smoother. Any pillowing and sagging on the upper part will get smoothed out by the layers put on top.
* Your print will be more watertight. More solid layers on the top will be more capable of blocking water or other fluids from getting in.
* Your print will use more material, since more layers are fully filled.
* Your print will take more time, since more material must be placed down. Besides, the top layers are normally printed more slowly than the infill.
