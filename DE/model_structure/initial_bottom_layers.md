Initial Bottom Layers
====
### **Description**
Initial bottom layers refer to the print's bottommost layers that rest on the build plate. The Initial Bottom Layers setting configures the number of initial bottom layers.

The initial bottom layers are part of the bottom layers. However, you can configure different settings for the initial bottom layers from the rest of the bottom layers.

### **Usage**
By adjusting settings for all the bottom layers, you can make the print watertight, hide the infill from sight, and improve model strength. However, that will also cost more material and time. 

If you adjust those settings only for the very bottom layer or two, you can still get a watertight model with little shine-through effect of the infill. Although the strength of the print will be compromised, a lot of time and material can be saved.

Therefore, if strength is not an issue, it's useful to configure initial bottom layers to improve the quality of your print bottom.
