Bottom Layers
====
### **Description**
This setting configures how many solid layers are printed for the bottom of the print. 

Different from the normal layers that are made up of walls and infill, the bottom layers are solid layers. They are fully printed so as to close the gaps at the print bottom.

### **Influence**
By increasing the number of bottom layers, you can achieve the following effects:
* Your print will be more watertight. The bottom layers can close gaps on the bottom side of your print.
* Your print will be stronger. Having more bottom layers will mean that your print will be made more firm, with less infill and more solid layers.
* Your print will cost more time and material.
