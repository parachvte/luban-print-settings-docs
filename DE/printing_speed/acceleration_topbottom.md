Top/Bottom Acceleration
====
### **Description**
This setting controls how fast the nozzle accelerates into different directions while printing the top and bottom of the object. 

### **Influence**
Increasing this setting will have the following two effects:
* Increasing this setting compared to the rest of the print can save some time. Since the top and bottom sides typically consist of long straight lines, the nozzle can reach great speeds during printing. The nozzle must also make sharp corners with the typical lines pattern for the skin, which requires great acceleration. 

* However, increasing this setting will cause the printer to shake more as well, but the accuracy of the top and bottom sides is not normally a constraint because they are surrounded by walls.

### **Usage**
The Top/Bottom Acceleration can be set to a different rate than the rest of the print.
