Top/Bottom Jerk
====
### **Description**
This setting determines the speed at which the nozzle can go through corners while printing the top and bottom sides of the print.

### **Influence**
Increasing this setting will have the following effects:
* Increasing the Top/Bottom Jerk will prevent the nozzle from coming to a standstill in the corners between adjacent skin lines. This will allow the line width to be more consistent overall. 
* While increasing the jerk too much can cause the build plate to vibrate, creating an uneven surface. It could even cause the motors to lose steps, which would lead to a layer shift.

### **Usage**
This setting can be configured separately from the rest of the print.
