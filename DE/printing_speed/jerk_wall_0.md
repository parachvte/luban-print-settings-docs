Outer Wall Jerk
====
### **Description**
This setting determines the speed at which the nozzle can go through corners while printing the outer wall. This can be configured separately from the inner walls.

### **Usage**
During the printing of the outer walls, the printer is very sensitive to vibrations. The vibrations of the toolhead will be visible in the form of ringing in the final print. It's useful to print the outer walls at a lower jerk rate than the inner walls for this reason.

However, a lower jerk rate will make the corners less sharp on the outside, because the nozzle will slow down further in the corner and then extrude more material in the corner as well.
