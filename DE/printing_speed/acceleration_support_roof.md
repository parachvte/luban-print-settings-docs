Support Roof Acceleration
====
### **Description**
This setting controls how fast the nozzle accelerates into different directions while printing the support roof. 

### **Influence**
The support roof is more sensitive to inaccurate printing, because it directly affects the overhang quality. Enabling the support roof to have a lower acceleration rate than the support bottom can give better overhang quality for a similar printing time.

### **Usage**
The Support Roof Acceleration can be set to a different rate than the support floor.
