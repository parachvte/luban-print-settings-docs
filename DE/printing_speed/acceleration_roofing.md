Top Surface Skin Acceleration
====
### **Description**
This setting controls how fast the nozzle accelerates into different directions while printing the top surface. 

### **Influence**
* Reducing this setting can achieve better water tightness while not adding much printing time as when the entire top surface is adjusted.

* Reducing this setting will also reduce vibrations through the printer. Depending on the build structure of your 3D printer, these vibrations may cause the build plate to vibrate as well, making the surface uneven. 

### **Usage**
The Top Surface Skin Acceleration can be set to a different rate than the rest of the skin.
