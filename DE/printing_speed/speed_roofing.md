Top Surface Skin Speed
====
This setting adjusts the speed at which the top surface layers are printed, if there are any top surface skin layers as configured with the [Top Surface Skin Layers](../shell/roofing_layer_count.md) setting.

The top surface is very visible, so it is worth the extra time to print this at a lower speed than the rest of the skin, thereby improving the visual quality and water tightness of the top surface. Reducing the Top Surface Skin Speed too much though will introduce a great flow change when switching to and from the top surface.
