Support Infill Acceleration
====
### **Description**
This setting controls how fast the nozzle accelerates into different directions while printing the main part of the support. 

### **Influence**
Increasing this setting enables the printer to print the support faster, but less carefully. A higher acceleration rate for support infill will reduce the printing time, but increases the chance for the printer to knock over the support as well and will make the support structure weaker. 

### **Usage**
Typically the support is printed at raised acceleration compared to the rest of the print. The Support Infill Acceleration can be set to a different rate than the support interface.
