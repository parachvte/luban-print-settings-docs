Travel Acceleration
====
### **Description**
This setting controls how fast the nozzle accelerates into different directions while travelling across the build volume. 

### **Influence**
Setting the Travel Acceleration rate too high can cause the motors to lose some steps, leading to layer shifts.

### **Usage**
Since the printer is not extruding any material during the fast travel moves, any vibrations of the printer don't have any real effect on the print. As a result, the Travel Acceleration should be set pretty high to save printing time.

The Travel Acceleration can be set to a different rate than the rest of the print while material is extruded.
