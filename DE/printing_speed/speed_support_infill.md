Support Infill Speed
====
### **Description**
This setting configures the speed at which the main support structures are printed. It should be noted that the main support structures do not include the roof and floor.

### **Influence**
Increasing this setting too much will cause a difference in flow rate between the support and the rest of the print, which leads to overextrusion when switching from support to the print and underextrusion when switching from the print to support.

### **Usage**
Normally the support doesn't need to be printed very accurately, so it is safe to print the support at a higher speed than the rest of the print. This can save some printing time.
