Infill Jerk
====
### **Description**
This setting determines the speed at which the nozzle can go through corners while printing infill. 

### **Influence**
The infill is normally not visible from the outside, so increasing this setting can save some printing time. Increasing the Infill Jerk will also cause the printer to vibrate more, but the vibrations are hardly visible. 

On the contrary, reducing this setting adds more printing time while making your print stronger. 

### **Usage**
This setting can be configured separately from the rest of the print.
