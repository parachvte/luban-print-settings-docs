Support Floor Acceleration
====
### **Description**
This setting controls how fast the nozzle accelerates into different directions while printing the support floor. 

### **Influence**
Increasing the Support Floor Acceleration too much can incur additional scarring and may compromise the stability of the support that rests on it.

### **Usage**
The Support Floor Acceleration can be set to a different rate than the support roof. It is recommended to set the Support Floor Acceleration slightly higher than that of the support roof, to save some printing time.
