Prime Tower Acceleration
====
### **Description**
This setting controls how fast the nozzle accelerates into different directions while printing the prime tower.

### **Influence**
Increasing this setting allows the extrusion to be more constant, allowing for better priming. A higher acceleration rate for prime tower also reduces printing time. However, the prime tower may topple more easily if the acceleration rate gets very high and the printer vibrates a lot during its printing.

### **Usage**
The Prime Tower Acceleration can be set to a different rate than the rest of the print.
