Support Roof Jerk
====
### **Description**
This setting determines the speed at which the nozzle goes through corners while printing the support roofs. 

### **Influence**
The support roof is where the model rests on the support and mostly what counts for creating nice looking overhangs as well as where the support can leave scars. Both of these are a factor affected by the accuracy of printing the support roof. 

Increasing the Support Roof Jerk allows for a more constant extrusion rate. Especially for printers where the feeder is behind a long Bowden tube, getting the extrusion rate constant is a greater goal than reducing vibrations.

### **Usage**
This setting can be configured separately from the support floors.
