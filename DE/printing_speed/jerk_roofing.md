Top Surface Skin Jerk
====
### **Description**
This setting determines the speed at which the nozzle can go through corners while printing the top surfaces. 

### **Influence**
* Increasing this setting will prevent the nozzle from coming to a standstill in the corners between adjacent top surface lines, allowing the line width to be more consistent overall. This has a greater effect if the line width is much smaller than the nozzle size, which is a common use case for the top surface. 
* While increasing this setting too much can cause the build plate to vibrate, creating an uneven surface. It could even cause the motors to lose steps, which would cause a layer shift.

### **Usage**
This setting can be configured separately from the rest of the top side.
