Support Infill Jerk
====
### **Description**
This setting determines the speed at which the nozzle can go through corners while printing the main part of the support. 

### **Influence**
 Generally, increasing this setting makes the supports stronger as well as easier to remove, since the extrusion rate will be more constant. 
 
 While increasing the jerk too much increases the chance of a layer shift.

### **Usage**
This setting can be configured separately from the support interface.
