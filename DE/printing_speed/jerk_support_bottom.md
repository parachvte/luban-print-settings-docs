Support Floor Jerk
====
### **Description**
This setting determines the speed at which the nozzle can go through corners while printing the support floors. 

### **Influence**
While the support roof is critical both for scarring and for the overhang quality, the support floor only affects scarring. It has no bearing on the overhang quality because the model doesn't rest on it, only the support. This allows you to print the support floor somewhat less carefully than the support roof by adjusting this setting, to save some printing time.

### **Usage**
This setting can be configured separately from the support roofs.
