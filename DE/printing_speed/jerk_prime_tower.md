Prime Tower Jerk
====
### **Description**
This setting determines the speed at which the nozzle can go through corners while printing the prime tower.

### **Influence**
Reducing this setting reduces the vibrations going through the printer while printing the prime tower, which can prevent the prime tower from toppling over.

### **Usage**
This setting can be configured separately from the rest of the print.
