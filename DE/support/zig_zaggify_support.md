Connect Support Lines
====
### **Description**
If the lines pattern is chosen for the [Support Pattern](support_pattern.md), this setting makes the endpoints of the support lines to be connected together, making the support stronger. It also makes the support print with more continuous flow. Fewer travel moves will be necessary.

### **Influence**
Connecting the support lines has a couple of benefits, but also some downsides:
* The support will be more stable, less likely to topple over during printing.
* The flow rate will be held more constant, allowing you to print the support at greater speed without flow problems. This is especially important for support materials that are hard to extrude properly.
* If retractions are made during support, significantly fewer retractions will be necessary during the printing of support, which prevents the material from grinding.
* It takes more material to print the support.
* Usually it will take more time to print the support, since travel moves are normally faster than printing support lines.
