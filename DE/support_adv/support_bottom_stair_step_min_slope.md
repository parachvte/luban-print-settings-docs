Support Stair Step Minimum Slope Angle
====
### **Description**
With this setting you can disable stair stepping on the very bottom of the support, up until the slope of the model has a certain angle.

### **Influence**
Increasing this setting will prevent Luban from generating the stair steps on shallow surfaces. This will make the support more sturdy, but harder to remove. Your support will leave more scars on the surface. Reducing it will make support easier to remove and will leave a nicer surface where the support was resting, but in some cases it can cause support to have to bridge long distances or even appear to hang in mid-air completely.

### **Usage**
To get a nice surface, it's best to leave this setting at a conservative low angle, 5째 or 10째 or so. If the support rests on a surface that's shallow but not completely flat, inspect layer view and increase the angle if you find that support looks very precarious.
