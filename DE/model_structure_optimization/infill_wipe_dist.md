Infill Wipe Distance
====
This setting will make the nozzle travel a little bit further after it finishes printing an infill line. The aim of this small travel move is to wipe off the material onto the adjacent wall. This fuses the infill line to the wall better.

While this travel move makes the object stronger, the main disadvantage is that this travel move will cross the wall and leave a visible mark on the outside of the print. In effect, it makes the infill pattern shine through the shell more.

This setting only applies to the ends of the infill lines. When using connected infill lines, there will be much fewer ends.
