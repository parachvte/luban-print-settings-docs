Extra Skin Wall Count
====
### **Description**
When printing the top and bottom with the lines pattern, the outer rim of the skin areas can still be printed with a few concentric lines. This is different than printing an extra wall, because the extra skin wall gets put around each separate piece of skin instead of around the whole printing part.

### **Usage**
By configuring Extra Skin Wall Count, the printer will print a perimeter around the skin that the normal skin lines can attach to. This way, the skin won't sag as much in the end points. In the end, this tends to improve the quality of top surfaces a bit.
